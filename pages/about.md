# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}**,<br>
I am a code enthusiast. Highly experienced in developing WordPress websites. I have been working as a WordPress Developer for last 5 years.
I like messing with codes either it be something I know or don't know. While I am not working on WordPress, I love messing with Linux system and moder JS frameworks.

Like the starting program in every language, this is my first article in my site using Jekyll.

I have been very exicited to host my site in **Github Pages** since long. I started working on it about 6 months ago but left it in between( *my nature* ). I do not know the exact reason but maybe my nature of jumping on and off a particular thing. I have this habit of not concentrating on a single work for a long time. Even this time I was on/off this project since last 2 weeks.

I have again started working with **Github Pages** and **Jekyll**. But the problem was I could not configure it that easily like the last time. Also I had lack of knowledge on this. So I spent 1 week on just documentation. It was amazing to just going through what you have done before in theory. 

But the real trouble begin when I started setting up. I just kept getting error on setup only. The only reason I was stuck was that I was trying to set it up locally first. I had lower version of "ruby" then required. So I had to update ruby and all its gem. Anothe issue was working with the theme. First I was so confused about which theme to pick. I never knew there are so many themes on Jekyll and even premium themes. So finally I settled on this theme: [**PortfolioYOU**](https://github.com/YoussefRaafatNasry/portfolYOU) The next trouble I got head on was the `gh-pages gem`. It didn't support `jekyll 4.0.0` which was the default gem on inital setup of jekyll new site.

Anyways after going through all those errors, bugs and lack of knowlege, I started customization and data entry on my newly ready site. As I am writing this, I am still working on local setup. 

I just somehow feel relieved just to pushing it to master branch(*literally like moving site to live*). It's just a new experience of making it live

I hope to document my coding and bug-fixing troubles and stories on these articles.

>Untill then, May the Force be with you!!!!
